The software tools used for a specific project can be grouped and they form a  Development Environment.

They might depend on the IDE itself or each other, so standalone usage can be difficult and the whole IDE installation is required.</p> <p>DEM's goal is to reduce these dependencies and provide the possibility of standalone usage.</p>"},{"location":"#separated-environments-for-the-tools","title":"Separated environments for the tools","text":"<p>In a generic setup, the used tools can interfere with each other or the underlying host system, causing hardly detectable and fixable issues throughout the development process. It can be really  devastating to see two PCs generating different binaries from the same source, and after days of  debugging to find out that an environment variable had a different value for some obscure reason. </p> <p>To eliminate this problem, the tools need to operate in their own isolated environments. A  lightweight and fast solution for isolation is containerization. The tools get built into their  respective container images, and the way they communicate with the host system can be controlled.</p>"},{"location":"#scaleable-tool-management","title":"Scaleable tool management","text":"<p>Changes in the tools used for development may be necessary several times during the development  lifecycle.
