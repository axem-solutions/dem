## **`dem create DEV_ENV_NAME`**

Create a new Development Environment.

Running this command will open up an interactive UI on the command line. Follow the steps below to
configure the new Environment.

argument is the name of the Development Environment.

:warning: The supported docker run options:  
`-p, --name, -v, --privileged, --rm, --name, -d`  
See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) for more
info.

`*` Variable-length argument list that will be passed to the `docker run` command.

---

## **`dem export DEV_ENV_NAME [PATH_TO_EXPORT]`**

Export a Development Environment descriptor in JSON format to a text file. This file can be imported with the `load` command on another host. 

The way the file gets named can be set by the PATH_TO_EXPORT argument:

1. If it's not set, the file gets saved to the current directory with the name of the Development 
Environment and without extension.
2. If only a name is set, the file gets saved with that name to the current directory, optionally 
with the set extension.
3. If the argument is a directory path, the file gets saved there with the name of the Development 
Environment, without extension.
4. If the argument is a path with the file name, then the exported content gets saved into that file.
The extension can be set with the file name.

    successful import the DEM needs access to all the registries where the required images are 
    stored.
