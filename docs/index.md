# Introduction

## **What is DEM?**

DEM (Development Environment Manager) is an **open-source command line tool for setting up, managing, and sharing Development Environments** for software teams.

DEM empowers developers to **create, modify, and maintain consistent Development Environments with ease**, bridging the gap between code creation and deployment.

With DEM, you can manage your development infrastructure just as you manage your codebase. By adopting DEM's methodologies for environment setup and management, you can significantly reduce context switching and the time between ideation and execution.

## **Pain points addressed by DEM**

!!! success "Common pain points"
    ## 1. **Inconsistent Development Environments**
    - **Issue**: "It works on my machine" scenarios leading to inconsistencies.
    - **Solution**: **Consistent Development Environments** for every developer.

    ## 2. **Time-consuming Setup**
    - **Issue**: Slow and error-prone setup of Development Environments.
    - **Solution**: **Quick and reproducible installation** with a single command.

    ## 3. **Complex Tool Management**
    - **Issue**: Modifying the toolset is hard and time-consuming.
    - **Solution**: **Easy and scalable Dev Env management** where tools are like building blocks.

    ## 4. **Interruptions in Workflow**
    - **Issue**: Developers getting out of flow due to tool configurations.
    - **Solution**: Developers can **focus on their actual work**.

    ## 5. **Vendor-specific Limitations**
    - **Issue**: Vendor-specific interfaces causing standardization issues.
    - **Solution**: **Standardized Development Environments**.

## **Key features of DEM**

### :unlock: **Loose Coupling Between Tools**
- Traditional IDEs can make standalone usage of underlying tools difficult.
- DEM **reduces dependencies** and allows for standalone tool usage.

### :octicons-container-24: **Isolated Tool Environments**
- Tools can interfere with each other or the host system in generic setups.
- DEM uses **containerization** to create **isolated environments** for tools, ensuring consistency.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: **Scalable Tool Management**
- Changes in development tools are frequent.
- DEM allows **quick swapping of tool images** and ensures **safe coexistence** of different tool versions.

### :material-share: **Reliable Development Environment Sharing**
- Consistency across Development Environments is crucial.
- DEM enables **easy sharing** of Development Environments with coworkers.

### :rocket: **Quick and Reproducible Setup**
- Setting up new projects or modifying old ones can be time-consuming.
- DEM ensures **quick** and **simple installation**, and allows for **reinstallation whenever needed**.
