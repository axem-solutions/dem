It can be really  devastating to see two PCs generating different binaries from the same source, and after days of  debugging to find out that an environment variable had a different value for some obscure reason. </p> <p>To eliminate this problem, the tools need to operate in their own isolated environments. A  lightweight and fast solution for isolation is containerization. The tools get built into their  respective container images, and the way they communicate with the host system can be controlled.</p>"},{"location":"#scaleable-tool-management","title":"Scaleable tool management","text":"<p>Changes in the tools used for development may be necessary several times during the development  lifecycle.

This repository  is responsible for keeping track of the various versions of the image.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>An image repository stores the different versions of the same image. An image registry is a collection of image repositories.</p> <p>The DEM also uses registries in the background to store the tool images.
